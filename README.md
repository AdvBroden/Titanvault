The Instructions and Information of the Titanvault Administrator System.

# Ranking
The Titanvault Administrator system is split into a few Administrator Rankings, each ranking divided into numberic rankings that are customizable through the Settings Module Script that can be found in the ServerScriptService. Primarily, 180 will be used as the numberic ranking for temporary administrators that can be assigned through the command ":admin" which can be used by those who have the numberic ranking of 250. 250, is the current highest ranking in the Administrator System and whomever has this as their Numberic Ranking will be able to use all of the commands that the Titanvault Administrator showcases.
